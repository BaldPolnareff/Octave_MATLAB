# Octave_MATLAB
I hate this language but I need to use it for university exams, the code might even suck a lot, but you're free to use it (see license))

Feel free to contribute to the code if you happen to randomly find this repo, actually I encourage you as I might learn something about it

Btw I use ***Octave*** as it's Free Software, unlike MATLAB.
I encourage you to do it as well and contribute to the project
